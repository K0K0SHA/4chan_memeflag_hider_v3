# 4chan_memeflag_hider_v3
Greasemonkey/Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey/*Monkey module for hiding memeflags on 4chan.org/pol/

# HOW TO USE
Are you tired of memeflags on pol? Simply post the code in this repository's .js file into a new module for your Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, etc. extension. Tested on Violentmonkey on both Firefox and Chromium-based manifest v3 browsers.

# CREDITS
This project was originally forked from memeflag hider v2 which can be found here: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/438016-memeflag-hider-v2/feedback
The memeflag hider v2 works fine, except it requires the user to refresh the page in order to hide new memeflag replies. In other words, you have to keep refreshing the page to hide the new memeflag schizoposts. So, I upgraded the v2 code with some help from GPT-5 in order to check each new post for a memeflag. 

# TODO
Create GreasyFork repo and link it here
